From my first line of HTML to building full-stack MERN applications, my journey has been driven by curiosity and the desire to solve real-world problems.  
I believe in **learning by doing**, which is why my projects span a variety of industries — from e-commerce to social platforms.  
Every project taught me something new, whether it was mastering a new framework, optimizing database queries, or improving UI/UX designs.
